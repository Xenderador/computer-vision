# What is Computer Vision ?

[Computer vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-computer-vision/#:~:text=Computer%20vision%20is%20a%20field,tasks%20that%20replicate%20human%20capabilities.) is a field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to identify and understand objects and people in images and videos. Like other types of AI, computer vision seeks to perform and automate tasks that replicate human capabilities. In this case, computer vision seeks to replicate both the way humans see and the way humans make sense of what they see.

The range of practical applications for computer vision technology makes it a central component of many modern innovations and solutions. Computer vision can be run in the cloud or on premises.
